# Class Data Description

Most students in the class showed limited familiarity with data tools beyond the basics. Excel or Google Sheets is the only tool that most students feel comfortable using, while more advanced skills such as SQL, programming, R/pandas, and version control are generally unfamiliar. This suggests that they may need more training to work with more complex data workflows.

All the students except one reported interest in writing articles, which shows that traditional journalism remains the core focus of the class. Moreover, more than half of the students indicated interest in graphics, suggesting learning how to present data-driven stories may benefit students in a combination of writing and visual communication.

The class is split in its use of LLMs. Half of the students use tools like ChatGPT or Gemini, mainly for quick questions or writing assistance, while the other half do not use them at all. This division may reflect different attitudes about whether these tools are useful and appropriate, especially in journalism work.

|Students|Yes|No|
|---|---|---|
|Interested in graphics|12|6|
|Using LLMs|9|9|
