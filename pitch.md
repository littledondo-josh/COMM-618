Background: Hengshui High School is one of China’s most famous high schools, known for its rigorous management and high college admission rates, especially for top two universities in China, Tsinghua and Peking University.

Hook: Over the past 15 years, the proportion of Hengshui students admitted to Tsinghua and Peking University was among the highest in the country, but in recent 5 years this rate seems to decline.

Story Idea: I want to explore why this trend is happening by data analysis, combined with the changes of educational policies.

Data: I plan to collect annual admission data from Hengshui High School and overall data from Hebei province, creating visualizations to show trends over time.

Interviews: I will interview education experts, high school teachers, and students to provide context and interpretation for the data.
