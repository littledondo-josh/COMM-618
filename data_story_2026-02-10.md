## [For Some Americans, the End of Obamacare Subsidies Means Falling Off a Financial Cliff](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/upshot/obamacare-subsidies-financial-cliff.html)

I think this is a data story with both clear strengths and weaknesses.

Its strength lies in the way it uses visualized data to vividly show how Obamacare subsidies affect people with different income levels, and changes of the trend of impact along with income. However, its weakness is that the data used is relatively limited and does not incorporate other relevant indicators, such as changes in overall health insurance coverage after the implementation of Obamacare. As a result, readers may find it difficult to grasp the broader impact of the policy.

If it were up to me, I would not only use data to show the effect of subsidies on different income groups, but also include the population share and regional distribution of these groups. This would give readers a clearer sense of which people are most affected. For example, some scholars point out that although Republicans advocate ending the subsidies, a significant portion of the people most affected may actually be constituents of Republican congressmembers, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the policy’s consequences.
