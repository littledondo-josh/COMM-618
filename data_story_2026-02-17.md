## [ICE Hired Thousands While the Rest of the Immigration System Shrank](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/us/ice-agents-hiring-immigration-system.html)

I find this data story strong in many respects.

First, it focuses on a timely and highly relevant topic. ICE has been especially controversial during the second Trump administration, particularly after two innocent citizens were killed in Minnesota in January. By connecting staffing data to these recent events, the story makes the issue feel urgent and meaningful rather than abstract.

Second, the story clearly presents the changes in ICE staffing numbers and compares them with those of other immigration agencies. This comparison effectively shows a shift in emphasis from legal processing to enforcement and deportation. 

Third, the article does not rely on numbers alone. It includes related policies and expert opinions to help interpret what the data means and to explore the possible consequences of these changes. This combination of data, policy context, and expert commentary makes the story more persuasive and easier to understand.

The story mentions the data on ICE’s budget, but it doesn't illustrate a chart to show where the budget goes, which I think is meaningful and can help us know better about how the angency changed since Trump's second administration.
