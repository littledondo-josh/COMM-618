# Data About China's Exports

Hi Editor,  

I plan to examine how China’s monthly exports to the United States changed in the 12 months before and after Trump’s 2025 inauguration, and compare this with China’s total monthly exports to the world. I believe this comparison can partly reflect the impact of Trump’s tariff-related executive orders on China’s export performance.

The dataset I will use comes from the General Administration of Customs of China, published through the Ministry of Commerce. It is a monthly series of China’s goods trade, and it includes both total exports to the world and exports specifically to the United States.

This dataset is well suited to my question because its monthly frequency aligns with the one-year before-and-after window, allowing for a direct comparison of trends around the inauguration.

I consider the data authoritative because it is officially published by the Chinese government and covers the full time period needed for my analysis. To further validate it, I cross-checked the series against UN Comtrade data and found the figures to be consistent. I chose the Chinese customs data because UN Comtrade’s monthly series is not always updated in time, and the U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide China’s total global export figures.
