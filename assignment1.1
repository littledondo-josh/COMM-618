# Critique on [China Birth Rate Hits Lowest Since 1949 in Blow to Baby Drive](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-19/macron-to-decline-trump-s-invitation-to-join-his-peace-board) from Bloomberg

Bloomberg’s story uses birth data and highlights the severity of China’s population decline through phrases such as “Lowest Since 1949” and “lowest on record.” It further combines related data on fixed-asset investment and GDP composition to argue that China’s economy is facing significant challenges.

The data sources are clearly identified as the National Bureau of Statistics (of China), and one graph is labeled as a “Bloomberg calculation.” However, the story does not provide a direct link to the original data.

I believe that to fully understand this report, readers need some prior knowledge, such as what birth rate, fixed-asset investment (FAI), and GDP composition mean. Otherwise, it is difficult to understand the graphs, since these concepts are not explained in detail in the story.

What I liked about this story is that the data are presented very clearly, with strong visualization. The charts are interactive rather than static images, allowing readers to move the cursor and see specific values at different time points. In addition, the article links demographic data with economic data, helping readers understand how the two influence each other.

The data in the report only go back to around 2000, while China’s population has undergone major changes since the 1980s. Therefore, I would like to see a longer-term trend of population change. The change in birth rates has many complex causes, and population policy can only solve part of the problem, so I also would like to see a more comprehensive analysis of the reasons.

The story relies mainly on graphs, and the text only provides a summary of conclusions without detailed explanations of the data. If the story could explain the data more fully, it would be clearer and more reader friendly.

Based on this story, I would like to explore additional economic data to show how changes in China’s population affect the economy.
