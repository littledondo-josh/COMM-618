## [Why more lawmakers are quitting Congress, and what it means for the midterms](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2026/congress-midterms-lawmakers-quit/)
### The Washington Post. Feb. 11, 2026
I think this is a good data story.

The story uses several line graphs to clearly illustrate a current trend in Congress: with each successive Congress, a growing number of members choose not to seek reelection, and most of them choose to retire or resign. The story also includes tables that detail the next steps taken by each member who has decided not to run again.

The trends revealed through the data are compelling and help shed light on some of the potential challenges Congress is currently facing. The story goes beyond presenting numbers by offering exploration and analysis. For example, it cites statements from members of Congress themselves, explaining that political polarization and legislative dysfunction are reasons for not seeking reelection. It also draws on data about members’ ages to show that an increasingly older Congress may be another factor contributing to the rising number of retirements.

That said, I believe the story could incorporate additional data and analyze the issue from more dimensions. Since it mentions political polarization, it could include data such as voting patterns or the number of bills passed to further substantiate that argument. Similarly, congressional salaries have remained unchanged for more than a decade, which would serve as useful supporting data and could easily be included to strengthen the analysis.
