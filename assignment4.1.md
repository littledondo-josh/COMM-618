# Subject: FOIA Request of ICE Training Expenditures

Dear FOIA Officer,

Under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552) and section 552a(d)(1) of the Privacy Act of 1974, I request existing records of ICE training expenditures for Fiscal Years 2023 through 2025. This includes costs for employee training programs, third-party training contracts, and training materials or facility rentals.

I am requesting only existing records and do not ask ICE to create new analyses. If possible, please provide the records in an electronic format such as Excel, CSV, or PDF.

This request is only for educational purposes as part of a journalism assignment.

If you have questions about the scope of this request, please contact me at js6713a@american.edu. Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Joshua Sun
