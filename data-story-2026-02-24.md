## [Why more lawmakers are quitting Congress, and what it means for the midterms](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2026/congress-midterms-lawmakers-quit/)
### The Washington Post. Feb. 11, 2026
I think this is a good data story.

The story uses several line graphs to clearly illustrate a current trend in Congress: with each successive Congress, a growing number of members choose not to seek reelection, and most of them choose to retire or resign. The story also includes tables that detail the next steps taken by each member who has decided not to run again.

The trends revealed through the data are compelling and help shed light on some of the potential challenges Congress is currently facing. To further explore and analysis what's behind the trends, the story cites statements from members of Congress themselves, explaining that political polarization and legislative dysfunction are reasons for not seeking reelection. The story also draws on data about members’ ages to show that an increasingly older Congress may be another factor contributing to the rising number of retirements.

But I think data of more dimensions can be included in the story to explain the trends in a better way. Since it mentions political polarization and legislative dysfunction, it could include data such as voting patterns or the number of bills passed over the years to support the quotes. Also, I've read somewhere else that congressional salaries have remained unchanged for more than a decade, and that can be useful data to strengthen the analysis. With these data, the story would be more comprehensive and interesting.
