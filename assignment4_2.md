# Student's perceptions of the campus

On Feburary 2, the name of Professor Earl Anthony Wayne of AU SIS was found in Epstein files involved with unconfirmed allegations. The question I am curious about is how students’ perceptions of campus safety and trust in the institution change after these serious allegations become public.
I believe this is newsworthy because it highlights how students, as a directly affected community, respond to institutional crises. While reporting often focuses on the allegations themselves, student perceptions of safety and the university’s response receive less systematic attention.

I focus on two specific questions:

1.	Do students feel that the campus is still safe after learning about the news?

2.	Are students satisfied with the measures taken by American University so far (Feburary 4 afternoon)?

To collect the data, I conducted in-person interviews with 10 students on campus. Each participant answered the same two questions with yes, no, or neutral. All interviews were voluntary and anonymous. The questions did not ask to assess the truth of the allegations, so no special permission from the university was required.

|Students|Yes|No|Neutral|
|---|---|---|---|
|Feel safe|3|4|3|
|Satisfied with AU|0|9|1|

If this were a larger project, I would expand the number of interviews across different corners of campus and collect data of more categories such as age and gender, which are possibly related to perceptions of these issues.
